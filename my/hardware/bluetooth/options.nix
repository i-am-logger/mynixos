# Bluetooth hardware options.
#
# Declared beside the implementation rather than in the central
# my/hardware/options.nix, so the option exists only where something reads it.
# platforms/linux.nix imports this; the other platform does not, so setting it
# there is the module system's own "does not exist" error rather than silence.
#
# Type-only: my/hardware/options.nix carries `default` and `description` for the
# `hardware` submodule. Two declarations may merge, but only one may carry those,
# or it is a conflicting declaration rather than a merge.
